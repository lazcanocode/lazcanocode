## Somethings about me...
This is the place where I share some of my projects feel free to review, fork, star and report some issue in any repository. The feedback is always welcome!

## Some of my interesting are:
- Cloud computing and now I'm in focus on GCP
- I like MERN stack  and JS's asynchronism
